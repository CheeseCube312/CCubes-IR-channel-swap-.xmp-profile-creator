# XMP Profile Baker - Infrared Photography Tool

**Easily create Infrared Channel Swap Profiles for Lightroom**

## Project Description

This project easily lets users create custom .xmp files to do one-click-channel-swaps and warps using Lightrooms "Profile" functionality.

## What you need

- This projects files
- a .dcp Profile that extends white-balance
- Lightroom/Photoshop Classic
- Python not required: if missing portable version will be downloaded automatically

## How this works

This project includes my own channel-swap Profiles. They allow for one-click channel swaps by using Lightroom Profiles thanks to their embedded LUT's. The raw files are in source_xmp_files. The raw files don't just work for infrared photography with Adobe Lightroom since the programs white balance bottoms out at 2000k, leaving it unable to balance out the heavy red tint in most IR photography. 

The common workaround are Infrared Profiles created using .dcp files that essentially remap the white-balance, extending it significantly. Since the channel swap profiles rely on that extended white-balance a pointer to said Profile needs to get "baked" into the .xmp file. That "Baking" is what this program is for.

There are 3 Options:
1. Rob Shea's Profiles: You installed his .dcp Profile pack. The Profiles are all labled the same.
2. Custom Profile, source name from your own Preset .xml-file
3. Manual input

Once done you can write the output into the ...\CameraRaw\Settings folder with one click.

```

## Quick Start

0. **Install Rob Shea's .dcp Profile Pack or Create Custom DCP Profile for extended white balance**
   - You probably already did this for extending Lightrooms White balance
   - If not, just follow Rob Shea's tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWAmW5fGFsA
     or
   - Download his .dcp Pack here: https://www.robsheaphotography.com/infrared-profile-pack/

1. **Run the Program**
   - Double-click `run_portable.bat`
   - Select either:
     1. Rob Shea's Profiles
     2. Extract from .xmp file*
     3. Manual input
   - Run program

2. **Get Your Files**
   - Processed XMP files will be in the `output/` folder
   - Click 

3. **Install in Lightroom**
   - Copy + Paste them into `%APPDATA%\Adobe\CameraRaw\Settings`
   - Restart Lightroom
   - Check under "Profiles" if they're installed


*To grab a custom name from an .xml profile you need to export one first.
Open Lightroom, select your extended-WB-profile, Click '+' in "Presets", then "Create Preset". Set [x] tick at "Treatment & Profile", create preset.
You can now load that .xml into the program. The "Browse Files..." should open the correct folder by default

## Requirements

- **Windows** (tested on Windows 10/11)
- **Custom infrared DCP profile** (created for your camera)
- **Adobe Lightroom** (Photoshop not required)

## Included Profiles

The tool includes these infrared channel manipulation profiles:

### Channel Swap
- **Channel Swap G-B.xmp** - Swap Green and Blue channels
- **Channel Swap R-B.xmp** - Swap Red and Blue channels
- **Channel Swap R-G.xmp** - Swap Red and Green channels

### Channel Warp
- **Channel Warp B-G.xmp** - Blue to Green channel warp
- **Channel Warp B-R.xmp** - Blue to Red channel warp  
- **Channel Warp G-B.xmp** - Green to Blue channel warp
- **Channel Warp G-R.xmp** - Green to Red channel warp
- **Channel Warp R-B.xmp** - Red to Blue channel warp
- **Channel Warp R-G.xmp** - Red to Green channel warp

### Complex Transforms
- **Swap GB Warp RB.xmp** - Green‚ÜîBlue swap + Red‚ÜíBlue warp
- **Swap GB Warp RG.xmp** - Green‚ÜîBlue swap + Red‚ÜíGreen warp
- **Swap RB Warp GB.xmp** - Red‚ÜîBlue swap + Green‚ÜíBlue warp
- **Swap RB Warp GR.xmp** - Red‚ÜîBlue swap + Green‚ÜíRed warp
- **Swap RG Warp BG.xmp** - Red‚ÜîGreen swap + Blue‚ÜíGreen warp
- **Swap RG Warp BR.xmp** - Red‚ÜîGreen swap + Blue‚ÜíRed warp


## Troubleshooting

**"Python not found"**
- Install Python from [python.org](https://python.org)
- Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation

**"No XMP files found"**
- The source XMP files should be included
- If missing, re-download the tool
