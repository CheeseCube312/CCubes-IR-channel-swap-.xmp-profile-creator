üìÅ DCP Profile Folder
====================

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Copy your custom infrared .dcp profile into this folder
2. Profile location: %APPDATA%\Adobe\CameraRaw\CameraProfiles\Imported
3. Example: "Sony A7 II Infrared.dcp"

Once you place your .dcp file here, run the program using "run_program.bat"

The program will embed your DCP profile reference into the XMP files,
creating universal profiles that work with your specific camera's
extended white balance capabilities.
